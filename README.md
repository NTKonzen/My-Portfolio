# My Website #
Welcome to the repository containing all my code for my personal website. This is a project I began to create a centralized site that I can send to peers and potential employers. This solves the issue of having to host my personal info on various different sites. I also like being able to design every aspect of the page. Much of this project was built using Bootstrap, but a good amount of personalized CSS was also used to get it looking exactly how I wanted it. The page is fully size responsive, mobile friendly, and easy to adjust whenever I need to. Please feel free to use the code I've created as you will.

Thank you to [BootStrap 4.4](https://getbootstrap.com) for making this project ten times easier than it would have been
