      <p class="col-md-6 col-xl-6">I was born just over 21 years ago into a family of 6, including myself of course.
        Growing up, it seemed that every role in our family was taken. There was my older brother, the athletic one, my
        sister, the rowdy one, and my little brother, the academic one. So in the end, all that left me with is tech! So
        of course like anyone who was the tech-savvy kid in their household, I grew up fixing the wifi when it shut off
        and setting up my parents phones whenever they got new ones. Unfortunately I was never able to explore my
        fascination with software until rather recently when I signed up for a Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp
        offered through the UCSD Extension Campus. I’m excited to say that in this bootcamp I have been progressing well
        and learning a lot from my teachers and classmates.</p>
